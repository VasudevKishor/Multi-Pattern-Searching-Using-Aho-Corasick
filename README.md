# Multi-Pattern-Searching-Using-Aho-Corasick
Aho-Corasick is an efficient algorithm for multi-pattern string searching. It constructs a trie (prefix tree) of the given patterns and enhances it with failure links to allow fast matching in O(n + m + z) time, where:  𝑛 n is the length of the text ,𝑚 m is the total length of all patterns 𝑧 z is the number of matches
